# 📝 To-Do List App (with Local Storage)

A simple and elegant **To-Do List web app** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This app allows users to **add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete** — with all data saved in the browser’s **local storage**, so your tasks remain even after refreshing or closing the tab.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Add new tasks easily  
✅ Edit or update existing tasks  
✅ Delete unwanted tasks  
✅ Mark tasks as completed

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. When a new task is added, it’s stored in the browser’s `localStorage`.
2. On page reload, tasks are loaded automatically from localStorage.
3. Each task can be edited, marked complete, or deleted.
4. The app dynamically updates the stored data whenever a change is made.
